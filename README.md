akerl/keys
============

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/akerl/keys/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/akerl/keys)

My pubkeys for various devices

## Usage

I generally install these via [key_sync](https://github.com/akerl/scripts/blob/master/key_sync).

There is also [a Docker image](https://github.com/dock0/pubkeys) that serves all the keys here via a webserver
